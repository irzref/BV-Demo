## Instructions
To see the code in action, clone or download the repository. Navigate to the directory in your terminal of choice and run `npm install`.

After npm installs all of the dependencies, type `npm run build` to bundle all of the assets with webpack.

You can then open `dist/index.html` in your browser. This should show a basic Leaflet map with a point on the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. Viewing the page source confirms that all assets are coming from one `bundle.js` file.

## Usage
This webpack configuration is as bare-bones as possible to work with Leaflet. If you are going to use it for development, I recommend [a basic understanding of webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/).

You will probably want to update the webpack config to include a transpiler, `dist` folder clean-up, `webpack-dev-server`, etc.
